This is an example application that uses [Ceramic](https://ceramic.network), based on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

Deployed to https://ceramic-starter.ukstv.me via [Fleek](https://fleek.co)

Fork it freely.

## Getting Started

After installing the dependencies, add a token to [INFURA](https://infura.io) for WalletConnect to work by adding a file `.env.local`:

```shell
NEXT_PUBLIC_INFURA_TOKEN=some-secret-token
```

Then run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
